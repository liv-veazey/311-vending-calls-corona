    <p> Police watch as unpermitted fruit and vegetable sellers conduct business on Roosevelt Avenue // Olivya Veazey </p>

    <h1>Can Corona Accommodate its New Small Businesses?</h1>

    <h5>City legislation to increase and expedite street vending permits remains stalled, and city data shows that complaints have only gotten worse in the last two years.

   <div class="story">
    <p>An analysis of city data found that 311 calls regarding street vending violations in neighborhoods along Roosevelt Avenue have increased by more than eightfold in the last two years.</p>

<iframe title="311 Calls Concerning Street Vending" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-MFTrG" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MFTrG/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="551" data-external="1"></iframe>


    <p>Christian Cassignol, who grew up in Corona and has worked for over a decade as the District Manager of Queens District Four, said that he is unsurprised by the increase and has never seen the neighborhood so full of street vendors.
    </p>

    <p>Corona, Jackson Heights, and Flushing have some of the densest populations of mobile street vendors, according to <a href="https://jauerbach.github.io/research/auerbach_vendor_2024.pdf">a study by Jonathan Auerbach</a> of George Mason University. And according to <a href="https://immresearch.org/publications/street-vendors-of-new-york/">a report by The Immigration Research Initiative</a>a, 96 percent of street vendors see vending as their primary source of income.
    </p>

    <p>Advocates and vendors alike say they would love to do their work by the book, if only the city would give them proper permitting.
    </p>

    <p>“I need the permit,” said Maria, who vends on Roosevelt Avenue and asked that her full name be withheld because of concern for her immigration status. Maria has received three tickets from the Police for unpermitted vending in the past year.
